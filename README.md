Programmation CoffeeScript en Fran√ßais

This project has two goals:

1) Make an (online) interpretor for the language CoffeeScript, but in
French, and mathematics oriented.

2) shelter some maths lessons and exercises designed as webApps, which
can easily run on a tablet

3) (OK that makes 3, not 2, but this one is no goal yet; maybe in a
future time) a webApp which eases the making of the resources of point
2: Some kind of exercise builder.
